# CNN_CIFAR10
### Project Description
Our project explores the application of Decision Tree and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) models to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset, a task aimed at understanding the strengths
and limitations of traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches in image
classification. While the Decision Tree model achieved a test accuracy of 23.65%, Random
Forest reached an accuracy of 46.86%, CNN significantly outperformed it with an accuracy
of 89.79%, highlighting the importance of spatial feature extraction in image classification
tasks.
